Sparse Indexing :- Checking records in a given range, direct jump to nearest index and the search is completed in lesser time.
Dense Indexing :- Random Data Search refers to dense, each record is given an address, then the search is performed.
If attribute in index table doesn't match then it will search the full table
If the table is in a shuffle/random/unordered form then in that case dense indexing is performed due to randomisation and also backtracking is also not allowed.
If Attribute Key doesn't match then the whole table needs to be searched.
For Unique Index, the attribute key should be unique in the table itself.
Unique Composite Index Table with multiple columns can be created if any one of the column is unique.

Creating a Non-Unique Index:-(Any column can be considered as attribute key)
create index index1 on EMP(ename); // For creating index for table(column_name)
drop index index1 // To delete(drop) any index created by you
select * from user_indexes // To see all indexes created till now
create index index2 on EMP(ename,sal); // Creating index with multiple column(s)

Creating Unique Index:-
create unique index uindex1 on emp(ename); // It is checking that the column specified in not having duplicacy. It is not interessted that the column specified is a Primary key or not.
create unique index uindex2 on emp(ename,hiredate); // Condition is that atleast one column should be unique.
alter index uindex2 rename to myuindex1; // To rename index

BitMap Index:-
If we have data in any other format, to index that we use BitMap Indexing.
create bitmapindex index_name on table_name(column_name);
